# Design Guidelines Needed - Insufficient Information

I need more information to create comprehensive design guidelines for your app. Currently, I only know you want to create "a native app for app store," but I need to understand:

## Required Information

1. **App Purpose** - What problem does this app solve? What will users do with it?
   - Examples: Habit tracker, recipe organizer, fitness coach, meditation timer, budget planner, etc.

2. **Core Features** - What are the main things users can do?
   - Examples: Create items, browse content, track progress, share with friends, etc.

3. **Target Audience** - Who will use this app?
   - Examples: Busy professionals, students, fitness enthusiasts, creative hobbyists, etc.

4. **Platform** - iOS, Android, or both?

## Example Request Format

"Create a habit tracking app for iOS where users can:
- Add daily habits with custom icons
- Mark habits as complete each day
- View streak history and progress charts
- Set reminders for each habit"

OR

"Create a recipe discovery app where users can browse recipes by category, save favorites, and create shopping lists."

**Please provide details about what your app should do, and I'll create comprehensive design guidelines including:**
- Navigation architecture
- Screen-by-screen specifications  
- Color palette & typography
- Custom assets list
- Complete design system
