## 4) Backend design prompts (security-first)

### Authentication and security
- Use OAuth2/OIDC or a secure authentication service (e.g., Firebase Auth, Auth0, or your platform’s provider)
- Enforce strong password requirements and MFA if available
- Email/phone verification (OTP) during signup
- Session management with short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+)

### Data access and privacy
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for admins vs users
- Privacy settings per photo and per connection
- User consent for data sharing; provide clear opt-in/opt-out for features (photos, location sharing)
- Store only necessary personal data; minimize sensitive data retention
- Regular security audits and logging of access events

### Photo handling
- Validate and sanitize uploaded images
- Restrict image sizes and dimensions to optimize storage
- Use a secure object storage (e.g., AWS S3 with signed URLs, or platform-provided storage)
- Serve images via CDN with proper access controls
- Implement temporary signed URLs for photo access as needed

### Location and search
- Store geocoordinates (lat, lon) and perform radius-based queries using geospatial indexing
- Allow search by:
 - Radius: distance between user and other profiles
 - Suburbs: exact suburb matching
- Rate-limit search requests to prevent abuse
- Provide a clearly stated privacy approach for location sharing

### Messaging
- End-to-end encryption is complex in consumer apps; if not feasible, implement server-side encryption for at-rest and in-transit
- Store messages with timestamps; mark read/unread per user
- Implement moderation flags for inappropriate content in messages
- Support media messages with size limits and scanning for safety

### Payments and App Store features
- Implement in-app purchases for premium features or subscriptions
- Restore purchases: provide a robust restore flow using platform purchase receipts
- Handle subscription state changes, proration, and grace periods
- Compliance: adhere to App Store guidelines (device capabilities, entitlement management, privacy disclosures)

### WhatsApp integration (optional)
- If enabling contact sharing via WhatsApp:
 - Provide a Share Intent that opens WhatsApp with a prefilled message (consent-based)
 - Do not automatically message users without explicit user action
 - Respect user privacy—show clear opt-in for external chat apps
